# Simple_Currency_Converter
A very basic program that converts $, £ and €
* As part of a college assignment, we were given the simple task writing program that converts €, $ and £ into one another.
* We were told that program should ask the user to choose the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert into, then should ask for the amount to convert, and return the result of the conversion onto the screen, using the exchange rates that were on www.xe.com when we were doing the assignment.
* We did not need to create a live one using an API, but I might in the future
